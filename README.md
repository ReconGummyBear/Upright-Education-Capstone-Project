Showcase of the capstone project I performed at the end of my data analytics bootcamp with Upright Education.
The task was to network in order find a sponsor to provide me with a sizable dataset to perform an exploratory data analysis.
My sponsor, A Better Way Realty, provided me with a very large dataset containing every sale of a detached home in the Southside Hampton Roads area from 2004-2023.
